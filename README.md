The Unity version used is `2020.3.11f1 Personal`.

Some files have been ignored in order to upload this repo to Github:
1. The soundtrack was ignored because the file size was too large for GitHub. **It is needed to build the project.** You can download `Soundtrack.zip` [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18jwFu-SKwPjdhQHHEr1fVACGk-IGBfFU/view?usp=sharing). Unzip it, and place `Soundtrack` and `Soundtrack.wav` in the directory `Assets/Project/Sounds`.
2. The trailer was ignored because the file size was too large for GitHub.
3. The Steam SDK was ignored because I don't know if it's legal for me to host it here.
